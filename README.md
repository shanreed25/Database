# Database
- Databases are used to store, manage, and retrieve data for applications
- are essential for the core functions of most applications, enabling tasks like searching, sorting, reporting, and sharing information
- act as the "memory" for software applications, storing all necessary information, from user profiles to complex transaction records
- developers interacting with them via query languages like SQL to perform operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting data (CRUD)
- database design, query optimization, data security, and choosing the appropriate database system (DBMS) for a given project's needs are key aspects of this relationship include


## Database Design
- the database's structure (schema) 
- created by defining tables, relationships, and other objects, ensuring it aligns with the application's requirements

## Database Types
- Software development utilizes various types of databases, each suited for different data structures and application requirements. 
- **Relational Databases (SQL)** best for applications requiring data integrity, consistency, and complex relationship management. 
    - **Structure:** Organize data into tables with predefined schemas, rows, and columns. Relationships between tables are established using foreign keys.
    - **Strengths:** Data integrity, strong consistency, well-suited for complex queries and structured data.
    - **Examples:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server.
- **NoSQL Databases (Non-Relational)**best for handling unstructured or semi-structured data with flexible schemas, offering better scalability and performance for specific use cases
    - **Structure:** Offer flexible schemas, allowing for the storage of unstructured or semi-structured data. They are designed for scalability and handling large volumes of diverse data.
    - Examples: Document Databases(MongoDB, CouchDB), Key-Value Stores(Redis, DynamoDB), Wide-Column Stores(Apache Cassandra, HBase) and Graph Databases(Neo4j)
- there are other specialized databases such as In-Memory Databases, Time-Series Databases, Object-Oriented Databases and more
